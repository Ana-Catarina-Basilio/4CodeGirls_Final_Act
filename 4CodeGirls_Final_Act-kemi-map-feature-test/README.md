- **Booking System:** Securely book your favorite events directly through the platform.
- **Confirmation Emails:** Receive email confirmations for successful bookings.
- **Calendar Integration:** Add booked events to your calendar for easy access.


## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React, Leaflet.js, Redux, QRCode Generator
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, MySQL
- **Styling:** CSS
- **Communication:** RESTful API
- **Other Tools:** Git, GitHub, Trello (for task management)



## Getting Started

To run the Winter WonderMap locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Ana-Catarina-Basilio/4CodeGirls_Final_Act.git`
2. Install dependencies stated in package.json file : `npm install` 
3. Set up the database: Execute all SQL command queries of the DB_WonderWorld.sql file on MySQL.
4. In the backend folder, the app.js and db.js are responsible for api creation. Go to db.py and enter your SQL password.
5. Open another terminal and change directory to the backend folder and then run `node app.js` to start the backend. this action will load up localhost:3000
6. Start the frontend: `npm start` on the other terminal, if prompted to change your host location, accept by typing yes. This will navigate the front end to the next available localhost e.g localhost:3001


## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `/backend`: contains backend code(db.js and app.js), inactive subfolders: mailjet_api and  python_api_files (both reflect initial plan to use python for backend)
- `/database`: contains sql file (DB_WonderWorld.sql) for database setup.
- `/src`: contains the React frontend code.



## Usage

2. Filter events based on your preferences by selecting an event category
3. Book your favorite events on the booking page.
4. Receive a web confirmation for successful bookings.
